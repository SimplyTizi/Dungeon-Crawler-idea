# Dungeon Crawler concept
just a simple dungeon crawler idea using SDL


this program loads a .txt file and uses it as a map. depending on the character used on the file, it colors it as wall or floor, if not found it shoots an error in console.
and it has a simple camera movement that isnt attached to the map.
The feature I focused on the most was handling input so that if the user presses right, then left, and then releases left, the camera resumes moving right.

this is the first aproach i have so expect it to be a bit caotic, I will be uploading a cleaner version soon.
